## Introduction
**TuGraph Analytics** (alias: GeaFlow) is the [**fastest**](https://ldbcouncil.org/benchmarks/snb-bi/) open-source OLAP graph database developed by Ant Group. It supports core capabilities such as trillion-level graph storage, hybrid graph and table processing, real-time graph computation, and interactive graph analysis. Currently, it is widely used in scenarios such as data warehousing acceleration, financial risk control, knowledge graph, and social networks.

## Development Manual

GeaFlow supports two sets of programming interfaces: DSL and API. You can develop streaming graph computing jobs using GeaFlow's SQL extension language SQL+ISO/GQL or use GeaFlow's high-level API programming interface to develop applications in Java.
* DSL application development: [DSL Application Development](docs/docs-en/application-development/dsl/overview.md)
* API application development: [API Application Development](docs/docs-en/application-development/api/overview.md)

## Real-time Capabilities

Compared with traditional stream processing engines such as Flink and Storm, which use tables as their data model for real-time processing, GeaFlow's graph-based data model has significant performance advantages when handling join relationship operations, especially complex multi-hops relationship operations like those involving 3 or more hops of join and complex loop searches.

Association Analysis Demo Based on GQL:

```roomsql
--GQL Style
Match (s:student)-[sc:selectCource]->(c:cource)
Return c.name
;
```

Association Analysis Demo Based on SQL:

```roomsql
--SQL Style
SELECT c.name
FROM course c JOIN selectCourse sc 
ON c.id = sc.targetId
JOIN student s ON sc.srcId = s.id
;
```
