# üåà [G6VP](https://github.com/antvis/g6vp) now supports visualization of flow graph jobs in collaboration with Tugraph!

## Just 5 steps to present üéä

### 1. Start the GeaFlow calculating job and Socket service

Reference [Quick Start](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-analytics/blob/master/docs/docs-cn/quick_start.md)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that in the 'start SocketServer' step use the following command instead

```bash
bin/socket.sh 9003 GI
```

When the terminal outputs the following, Tugraph Analytics is ready to establish a connection.

> If any problem occurs during service startup, see https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-analytics/issues/1

### 2. Create a G6VP project

Enter [New Canvas](https://insight.antv.antgroup.com/#/workbook/create), enter a workbook name. We will manually add the dot edge data later, so choose a case data set here, and use the **minimalist template**

### 3. Add Components

We need to add two components, in the toolbar add **Clean canvas**; Then add **Loop Detection Demo** to the side container of the default layout

> The project canvas should look like this

Click the 'üßπ Clear' option in the toolbar to clear the canvas node

By default, a connection is automatically established after the Loop Detection Demo component is added.

Tugraph Analytics will also output the following after the connection is established:

### 4. Demostration

Loop detection Demo provides two ways to interact:

* Method 1 Enter the dot information in the input box
* Method 2 Demonstrate using built-in data

> Both methods essentially call Tugraph Analytics for real-time calculations, but Method 2 omits the manual input process.

Here we use the built-in data for a quick demonstration, click [Options], select 'Add Points', 7 points of information appear in the canvas; Then select 'Add Edges'. We can see the add record in the above dialog.

Similarly, the Tugraph Analytics terminal outputs operational information in real time and automatically starts computation tasks.

### 5. Result Presentation

After the loop detection calculation task is completed, Tugraph Analytics automatically returns the detection results.

The loop detection results are dynamically displayed on the right canvas:
