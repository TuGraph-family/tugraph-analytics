Here is the documentation map to help users quickly learn and use geaflow.

## Introduction
**TuGraph Analytics** (alias: GeaFlow) is the [**fastest**](https://ldbcouncil.org/benchmarks/snb-bi/) open-source OLAP graph database developed by Ant Group. It supports core capabilities such as trillion-level graph storage, hybrid graph and table processing, real-time graph computation, and interactive graph analysis. Currently, it is widely used in scenarios such as data warehousing acceleration, financial risk control, knowledge graph, and social networks.

## Quick Start

Step 1: Package the JAR and submit the Quick Start task
1. Prepare Git、JDK8、Maven、Docker environment。
2. Download Code：`git clone https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-analytics`
3. Build Project：`./build.sh --module=gealfow --output=package`
4. Test Job：`./bin/gql_submit.sh --gql geaflow/geaflow-examples/gql/loop_detection_file_demo.sql`

Step 2: Launch the console and experience submitting the Quick Start task through the console
5. Build console JAR and image (requires starting Docker)：`./build.sh --module=gealfow-console`
6. Start Console：`docker run -d --name geaflow-console -p 8888:8888 geaflow-console:0.1`

## Development Manual

GeaFlow supports two sets of programming interfaces: DSL and API. You can develop streaming graph computing jobs using GeaFlow's SQL extension language SQL+ISO/GQL or use GeaFlow's high-level API programming interface to develop applications in Java.
* DSL application development: [DSL Application Development](5.application-development/2.dsl/1.overview.md)
* API application development: [API Application Development](5.application-development/1.api/1.overview.md)

## Real-time Capabilities

Compared with traditional stream processing engines such as Flink and Storm, which use tables as their data model for real-time processing, GeaFlow's graph-based data model has significant performance advantages when handling join relationship operations, especially complex multi-hops relationship operations like those involving 3 or more hops of join and complex loop searches.
